## 1. Basic Concepts

- **DBMS**: A software that handles the storage, retrieval, and updating of data in a database.
- **Database**: An organized collection of data.
- **Schema**: Structure of a database (tables, columns, etc.).
- **Instance**: Snapshot of the data in a database at a particular moment.

## 2. Database Models

- **Hierarchical Model**: Tree-like structure; parent-child relationship.
- **Network Model**: More complex, graph-like structure, allowing many-to-many relationships.
- **Relational Model**: Data is stored in tables (relations). The most commonly used model.
- **Object-Oriented Model**: Data is stored as objects, similar to OOP concepts.

## 3. Normalization

- **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Eliminate duplicate columns and create separate tables for related data.
- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: Eliminate partial dependency (no non-prime attribute should depend on part of a candidate key).
- **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: Eliminate transitive dependency (no non-prime attribute should depend on another non-prime attribute).
- **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**: Every determinant must be a candidate key.
  
## 4. SQL

- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Defines the schema. Includes `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Deals with data manipulation. Includes `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Deals with permissions. Includes `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**: Controls transactions. Includes `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`.

## 5. Transactions

- **Transaction**: A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work.
- **States**:
  - **Active**: Transaction is being executed.
  - **Partially Committed**: All operations are completed but not yet committed.
  - **Committed**: Transaction is successfully executed and saved to the database.
  - **Failed**: Execution stopped due to a failure.
  - **Aborted**: Transaction is rolled back.
  
## 6. Concurrency Control

- **Locks**: Mechanism to control access to data. Types:
  - **Shared Lock**: Allows multiple transactions to read data.
  - **Exclusive Lock**: Only one transaction can modify data.
- **Deadlock**: A situation where two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks.
- **Solutions to Deadlocks**: Timeout, Wait-Die, Wound-Wait, Deadlock Detection.

## 7. Indexing

- **Index**: A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations.
- **Types of Indexes**:
  - **Primary Index**: Created on the primary key.
  - **Secondary Index**: Created on non-primary key attributes.
  - **Clustered Index**: Alters the physical order of the table.
  - **Non-Clustered Index**: Does not alter the physical order.

## 8. Keys

- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: Ensures referential integrity between two tables.
- **Candidate Key**: A minimal superkey, which can be a primary key.
- **Composite Key**: A key consisting of two or more attributes.
- **Superkey**: A set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row.

## 9. Joins

Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

### Types of Joins:

1. **Inner Join**:
   - Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table1
   INNER JOIN table2
   ON table1.column = table2.column;
   ```

2. **Left (Outer) Join**:
   - Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. Unmatched rows from the right table will be NULL.
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table1
   LEFT JOIN table2
   ON table1.column = table2.column;
   ```

3. **Right (Outer) Join**:
   - Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. Unmatched rows from the left table will be NULL.
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table1
   RIGHT JOIN table2
   ON table1.column = table2.column;
   ```

4. **Full (Outer) Join**:
   - Returns all rows when there is a match in either table. Unmatched rows in both tables will show NULL.
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table1
   FULL OUTER JOIN table2
   ON table1.column = table2.column;
   ```

5. **Cross Join**:
   - Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., all combinations of rows.
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name(s)
   FROM table1
   CROSS JOIN table2;
   ```

6. **Self Join**:
   - Joins a table with itself.
   ```sql
   SELECT a.column_name, b.column_name
   FROM table_name a, table_name b
   WHERE condition;
   ```

## 10. Views

### Definition:
A **View** is a virtual table based on the result of a `SELECT` query. It doesnâ€™t store data itself, but presents data from one or more tables.

### Creating a View:
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Using a View:
You can use a view just like a regular table in `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations (with some limitations).

```sql
SELECT * FROM view_name;
```

### Dropping a View:
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

---

## 11. Procedures

### Definition:
A **Stored Procedure** is a prepared SQL code that you can save and reuse. It is a set of SQL statements that perform a specific task.

### Creating a Procedure:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (parameter1 datatype, parameter2 datatype, ...)
BEGIN
   -- SQL statements here
   SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition;
END;
```

### Example of a Simple Procedure:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeSalary (IN emp_id INT)
BEGIN
   SELECT salary
   FROM employees
   WHERE employee_id = emp_id;
END;
```

### Executing a Procedure:
```sql
CALL procedure_name (parameter1, parameter2, ...);
```

### Dropping a Procedure:
```sql
DROP PROCEDURE procedure_name;
```

## 12. ACID Properties

- **Atomicity**: Ensures that a transaction is either fully completed or not at all.
- **Consistency**: Ensures the database is in a valid state before and after a transaction.
- **Isolation**: Ensures that transactions are executed independently.
- **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains permanent.

---

## 13. Database Security

- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users.
- **Authorization**: Determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
- **Encryption**: Converts data into a secure format to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Ensures data can be restored in case of failure.

---

## 14. Important SQL Queries

1. **Select Query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
   ```

2. **Insert Query**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
   ```

3. **Update Query**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;
   ```

4. **Delete Query**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
   ```

---

## 15. Triggers (Optional)

### Definition:
A **Trigger** is a set of SQL statements that automatically executes in response to certain events (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) on a table.

### Example:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE INSERT
ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   -- SQL statements
END;
```
